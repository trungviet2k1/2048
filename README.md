# 2048
 2048 is a simple yet addictive puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid. By moving the tiles up, down, left, or right, tiles with the same value combine to form a new tile with double the value. The goal of the game is to create a tile with the value 2048. The game ends when there are no more valid moves available.
